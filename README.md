Student Data Report – Automated Semester Scheduling System
Overview

The Student Data Report project automates the semester scheduling process using publicly available university year catalogs. It optimizes course timetables across multiple programs, reducing what was previously a two-week manual scheduling process to just a few minutes.

This tool is designed to streamline academic planning for universities by generating conflict-free, optimized schedules and providing real-time insights through a dynamic dashboard.
