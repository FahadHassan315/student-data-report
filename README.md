Student Data Report – Automated Semester Scheduling System
Overview

The Student Data Report project automates the semester scheduling process using publicly available university year catalogs. It optimizes course timetables across multiple programs, reducing what was previously a two-week manual scheduling process to just a few minutes.

This tool is designed to streamline academic planning for universities by generating conflict-free, optimized schedules and providing real-time insights through a dynamic dashboard.

Key Features

Catalog Integration:
Includes the last five years of university catalogs, with the ability to select any of them or upload a new catalog for scheduling.

Automated Scheduling:
Generates optimized class schedules automatically for all programs and semesters, ensuring efficient use of rooms and faculty time.

Time Optimization:
Ensures no overlapping classes while creating time-efficient timetables tailored for each program, including undergraduate, MBA, and master’s programs.

Dynamic Dashboard:
A dashboard that automatically updates based on the selected catalog and semester, displaying all programs across all four colleges.

Efficiency Boost:
Reduces scheduling time from weeks to minutes, significantly minimizing manual effort and human error.
